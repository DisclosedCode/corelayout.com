### About

As a full-stack developer, I frequently work with a wide range of layouts and although there are many CSS frameworks that offer popular layouts, I've found that including entire libraries in my projects can result in bloated code and hinder performance.

To tackle this challenge, I decided to create my own personal collection of the most used layouts using pure CSS and take advantage of modern CSS features such as flexbox and grid.

Adopting this approach not only streamlined my development process, but also ensured a lightweight, maintainable, and efficient code base.
